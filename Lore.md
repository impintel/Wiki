Some information just for our operations:
* We are affiliated with the Sith Empire faction in the game. You can run whatever alignment or class you want, but everyone being in the same faction lets us play together. For roleplay reasons, we're focusing around Sith/Imperial Intelligence, as our two starting players use Operatives.
* * Of course feel free to take your character in whatever direction you want within the faction.
* For Player vs. Player (PvP) events, we will meet at Imperial Intelligence at the Kaas Citadel. This can also be our site for social events, roleplay events, and any other kind of ceremony. All players can unlock a quick-travel to Capital World, and then your standard quick-travel can take you directly to Intelligence.
* For Player vs. Environment (PvE), we'll group up at the command deck on the White Nova, the Harrower-class carrier just west of Vaiken Spacedock. Lots of vendors, flashpoint access, and character bank access makes this location ideal for planning ops.

# How Your Class Connects

Suprisingly, every class in SW:TOR on the Imperial faction ties in with Intelligence efforts. In the Empire, the elite, represented by player characters, are charged with governing and guiding day-to-day efforts of the citizenry, and Intelligence is tasked both with both gaining the information to make good decisions and with enforcing the infrastructure so that the community can thrive.

The current state of the Empire is five Spheres of Influence, covering several ministries, controlled by five [Dark Councillors](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Council) reporting directly to [Empress Acina](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Acina). Intelligence draws assets from each of these, represented by the player classes below. 

Remember that Intelligence needs to have visibility into each aspect of Imperial life to be effective, and we will make use of the strengths of any asset we can establish. The only members of Imperial life not under these Spheres are the Empress herself and the [Imperial Guard](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Guard) who serve her directly -- Intelligence should be particularly interested in infiltrating their ranks, to be closer to the Empress.

While much of this is for the purposes of lore, I have also tried to connect each class with the Reputation system it can complete most quickly -- use this as a cheat sheet to rapidly complete your Conquest objectives. Furthermore, I have endeavored to lay out the crew skills such that with five characters in a Legacy (two Agents, one Bounty Hunter, one Inquisitor, and one Warrior) you can cover all the crew skills, with any one character being able to be a complete crafter with the exception of the Warrior.

## Imperial Agent, representing the Sphere of Galactic Influence

Agents have the most obvious connection -- they are the most immediate assets to Imperial Intelligence, generally derived from non-Force-using military backgrounds. Dromund Kaas is a survivor culture, created after the Sith Emperor was chased into Unknown Regions after the [the Great Hyperspace War](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Empire/Legends#Great_Hyperspace_War), and the Agent is an ardent believer in doing whatever is necessary to preserve the Empire. Agents take the worst jobs with the lowest survival rates to make sure that the Empire's resources are used to greatest effect.

Agents will be charged with developing assets for the Empire and covertly demolishing enemy networks, to ensure the safety of Dromund Kaas. They work internal security, diplomatic relationships, enemy counterintelligence, and deep cover assignments. They take on enemies foreign and domestic -- sometimes it's hard for Agents to know who their friends are, but their knowledge and information gathering will expose the deepest conspiracies around the Empire.

This connects directly with the [Sphere of Galactic Influence](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sphere_of_Galactic_Influence) under Darth Xarion. Originally this sphere was two: the Sphere of Expansion and Diplomacy oversaw the Imperial Diplomatic Service while the Sphere of Imperial Intelligence oversaw the Ministry of Intelligence. Now, these have been folded together, with the new Sphere overseeing both the Imperial Diplomatic Service (exemplified by Vector) and the Sith Intelligence (exemplified by Lana Beneiko and Doctor Lokin).

## Bounty Hunters, representing the Sphere of Civil Administration

Bounty Hunters are hired mucle for the Empire, with the freedom to pursue their own contracts and their own social hierarchy. This independence allows to them to operate where the Empire's control is weakest, and their patrons give them the authority to enforce Imperial law in the heartland.

Hunters will serve classified contracts from Imperial military command throughout their campaign, curated through the Bounty Hunter's Guild. When Imperial assets would be too obvious to use or there were no special-forces available, Bounty Hunters are hired as anonymous black-ops contractors to clear Imperial objectives, coordinated through locations like Imperial dreadnoughts or the [Imperial Special Ops Center](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Special_Ops_Center) on Nar Shaddaa.

Hunters also tie into the [Sphere of Civil Administration](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sphere_of_Civil_Administration) under Darth Vowrawn, which is composed of the former Spheres of Production and Logistics and of Laws and Justice. In particular, hunters would receive many of the criminal bounties from Laws and Justice and they would often be hired as private security for corporations under Production and Logistics.

Ideal repuation systems:

* Social: Underworld Exchange

Ideal crew skills: Armstech, Scavenging, Investigation

## Sith Inquisitors, representing the Sphere of Sith Doctrine

Sith Inquisitors are drawn from the Force adepts most deeply connected with the [dark side of the Force](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_side_of_the_Force), from any background in the Empire. The Sith trials are arduous and dangerous, but they craft Inquisitors into elite interrogators and truth-seekers to protect the Empire. The strongest Sith form the Dark Council, the ruling body of the Empire, to whom Intelligence directly reports.

While most of the Inquisitor storyline is on curating the legacies and artifacts of now-dead Sith Lords to grow the power of the Empire, they are also the front-line on gleaning information from the dark side of the Force. In a galaxy rife with Force-sensitive organizations, Inquisitors are the most capable assets for gleaning crucial warnings from the Force itself and for stripping answers out of captured enemies.

The Inquisitor is tied to the [Sphere of Sith Doctrine](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sphere_of_Sith_Doctrine) under Darth Anathel, formerly composed of the Spheres of Ancient Knowledge, of Mysteries, and of Sith Philosophy. This Sphere is tasked with maintaining the lore and history of the Sith, understanding the dark side of the Force, and maintaining the Sith code. In this they are given command of the Imperial Reclamation Service, which serves as archaeologists, historians, and handlers of Sith artifacts. Given the awesome power of the dark side, they are a potent force for swaying any conflict.

See [this Fandom summary](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Nox) of the Inquisitor storyline if you need a review and don't care about.

Ideal reputation systems:
* Sorceror: Dread Executioners (Oricon)
* Assassin: Imperial Guard on Belsalvis (Section X)
* Social: Ziost
* Event: The Gree Enclave

Ideal crew skills: Archaeology, Artifice, Synthweaving

## Sith Warriors, representing the Sphere of Military Command

While Sith Warriors are rarely subtle in combat, they do serve a vital role for intelligence operations. [Darth Baras](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Baras), mentor to many promising Sith Warriors, operated key infiltration operations for the Imperial military. Many Warriors would follow in his footsteps, and they would serve as military intelligence and coordination assets during crucial campaigns.

In the intelligence context, Warriors are the enforcers. They are sent to silence compromised Intelligence assets to protect the operation of the network as a whole, and they are a bridge to the Imperial military command structure. Warriors are also skilled in manipulation tactics, using their fearsome reputation and dark-side prowess to turn enemy assets into allies, and they have plenty of black-ops contacts to get their operations finished as efficiently as possible, pushing the relentless march to victory for the Empire.

Warriors are excellent assets for getting eyes and ears inside the [Sphere of Military Command](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sphere_of_Military_Command) under Darth Krovos. Formerly this was known as the Ministry of War and was composed of three separate Spheres: Defense of the Empire, Military Offense, and Military Strategy. However, Acina saw a massive reduction in infighting by reducing the power structure from three competing Sith to one. Krovos herself saw honored combat success at Kuat alongside Admiral Rankin, and we would be wise to find access to her strength. This Sphere is responsible for the Imperial Army, Navy, Starfighter Corps, special-forces brigades, etc. -- effectively the entire military.

See [this Fandom summary](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Empire%27s_Wrath) of the Warrior storyline if you need a review and don't care about spoilers.

Ideal reputation systems:
* Juggernaut: [Iokath Imperial Forces](http://dulfy.net/2017/04/19/swtor-iokath-story-and-dailies-guide/)
* Marauder: [Ossus Assault Battalion](http://dulfy.net/2018/12/12/swtor-ossus-dailies-and-patch-5-10-gearing-guide/)
* Event: Ranked PvP

Ideal crew skills: Armormech, Underworld Trading, Treasure Hunting

## Class-independent solo systems for the Sphere of Scientific Advancement
The [Sphere of Scientific Advancement](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sphere_of_Scientific_Advancement) under Darth Savik controls the Imperial Science Bureau, formerly composed of the Spheres of Technology and of Biotic Science. The Science Bureau is responsible for such miracles as saving the planet Makeb from Republic destruction and works tirelessly to better understand the galaxy. 

Ideal reputation systems:
* [First Mobile Fleet, exploring Deep Space](http://dulfy.net/2013/02/12/swtor-galactic-reputation-guide/#4)
* Galactic Solutions Industries
* Macrobinocular quest series
* Darth Acina's Seeds of Rage quest line

## Untouched
As the Republic has shown a wonton disregard for making peace with the Empire in such a way that would allow light- and dark-siders to coexist, I do not recommend assisting their efforts any more than is convenient. That includes the coalition forces on Yavin 4 after the Revanite threat is dealt with and the Republic forces on Iokath trying to lock the Empire out of technological understanding.

# Ethical Consideration of the Empire
I wanted to put a post together on the ethics of Imperial Intelligence and where we fit into the Star Wars universe. 

## The Republic -- Utopic but Ineffectual

So, for Disneyverse and the top-level read of the Star Wars literature, the Light Side of the Force and the Jedi are the good guys, centered on the Galactic or New Republic when they're winning and the Rebellion/Resistance when they're losing. On the surface, their morality is easy -- only killing when they need to, fighting for the peace and freedom of all races. And, on a personal level, their paragons do this very well -- figures like Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Yoda do improve the lives of those around them. 

The Republic, on the surface, champions generally agreeable values -- law and order, driven by democratic representation; cultural diversity; free speech, etc. However, the fault in the Republic and the Light Side isn't in these personal ethics. The Republic on the galactic scale ends up being both ineffectual and selfish. Slavery for profit is rampant, despite being illegal, and criminal predation on the common people is commonplace with little enforcement of the law. The depths of Coruscant are full of the starving and suffering, and it's not uncommon for corporations to create dystopian living environments for citizens. Peace really only comes to the elite and the core families, such as House Organa of Alderaan, the Naboo Royal Family, the Skywalkers, and the Jedi. 

Where the Republic fails is at creating a functioning government that can craft, vote on, implement, and enforce laws. Darksiders seem to have a standing kill order against them, and this has led to many conflicts, including the purge after the Great Hyperspace War that drove the founders of Dromund Kaas to that world. The Republic has a longstanding toxic relationship with the Hutts, which has destroyed Quesh and Makeb for their incomptence.

What's more, the Republic lacks any real diversity. Most alien races within the Republic are either near-humanoid or pet-like. Species like the Talz, Wookies, and Ewoks seem to follow the Jedi around merely on the myth of their greatness, with an almost religious reverance. The Jedi seem to have a corner on the market for both authority and moral judgement, and the political and military engine of the Republic seems built to serve their interests -- there's little friction against Jedi ideals ever expressed, including of their habit of pressganging children into their warrior-monk ranks. What friction does exist, such as the schism that drove the Jedi from Coruscant to Tython, is generally overlooked as soon as the Jedi want something, such as command of a battlefleet to fight the Sith. Even when a miserably corrupt leader like Saresh assumes power, that leader isn't removed until an Imperial steps in.

What this means is that the Republic actually represents light-side fanaticism and stagnation -- it has a pretty facade of idealism, but within the light side fanaticism is a rot that such systemic stagnation can't cure. The focus on one's personal ideals and seeking personal enlightenment through nonattachment espoused by the Jedi turns into a hollow echo chamber seeking sameness where the different is considered a threat to be met with deadly force. This makes the Republic one form of extremists to be juxtaposed by the Dread Masters' own extremism of chaos.

## The Unaligned -- True Neutrality

Between the Republic and Empire fall the unaligned -- smugglers, bounty hunters, mercenary cells, and corporate interests. Often, these are normal people just trying to make their way in the galaxy. They are ethically neutral, as they're just people. Some are good, some are bad, but there's little last coherence to them -- they're the population of the galaxy and largely they can be categorized as the protectorates of the larger factions. Generally speaking, these people don't effect either harm or good on a galactic scale, save when their contributions sway one war or another.

Organizations like [GSI](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Solutions_Industries), [Czerka](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Czerka_Arms/Legends), and [CEC](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Corellian_Engineering_Corporation/Legends) can be generally benign to the galaxy, and some like GSI's THORN initiative actually help. Other times, the corporations that formed the Separatist Alliance during the Clone Wars show a dangerous interest in profit at the expense of the people. In short, much like individuals, these organizations can be good or bad and it depends on their leadership. 

There should be good respect given to these groups -- they don't start wars, they don't raze worlds, and they are generally the lifeblood of the economy throughout the galaxy, keeping food on the table. There's no personal shame in making an honest living, and people should have the right to choose this life.

## The Empire

The Empire is the definition of a necessary, Machiavellian evil. In order for the unaligned to have their worlds function, they need a government to provide law enforcement, disaster relief, shipping security, and social services. This is generally provided by governments like the Empire. The Empire, to this end, builds the Spheres of Influence for the Dark Council, which oversee these efforts. 

What makes the Empire remarkable is its lack of tokenism. The Empire will work with very disparate, alien forms of life, such as the artificial intelligence SCORPIO or the insectoid Killiks. Differences are embraced so long as the end result is benefit toward the cause -- in this way, the Empire is a meritocracy. In fact, the Empire is not a single society but several living in parallel even on Dromund Kaas. Sith, Mandalorian, mercenary, and common Imperial lifestyles co-mingle but none are consumed by the others. Their extraordinary powers put the Sith at the nominal top via the Dark Council, but they are often guided by Intelligence toward the right answers or defeated by bounty hunters when they become weak and inept. In this way, the differences form a coherent symbiosis. Interestingly, the Empire has no prohibition on lightsiders -- they often work with them when necessary, such as in the Yavin or Odessen alliances, and many Sith have recognized that the light side is just another aspect of the Force with its own utility.

The Empire is not without fault, though -- slavery exists, typically used as a punishment for a group or race's crimes against the Empire, though one can work hard to rise to a station of power from having been a slave, like Darth Nox or Major Anri. Sith can be fickle and there is little the average person can do to check a Sith's power. Imperial projects and military campaigns often come at high price, both to Imperial lives and to those outside the Empire. This can even be seen in the physical toll that the dark side exacts the body of a wielder. 

However, these faults arise not from a flaw in ideology but from a flaw in circumstance driving cruel pragmatism. The Empire is engaged in active, long-standing warfare with a Republic that would seek its annihilation -- favoritism to Sith is necessary to ensure they have the passion to draw on the dark side and counter Jedi. Slavery is chosen simply because the Empire cannot afford prisons -- all must work toward the goal, and mouths not working are dead weight it cannot carry. What's more, the Empire's top scholars are aware of deeper threats beyond the known galaxy -- there are cultures [that exist only to seek pain and death](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong), and the Imperial war machine must be able to pivot to deal with these threats. The sins of the Empire are a price paid in the moral and psychological toll on the powerful and powerless alike so that it can afford to keep far worse pain, death, and degradation at bay.

Despite this and despite the most heroic exploits of Imperials like [Katha Niar](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Katha_Niar) and Lord Cythirat never becoming public knowledge, what makes the Empire so remarkable is that they do create measurable good. Niar's strike team turned a suicide mission into both a tactical advantage for the Empire and the salvation of a world the Republic would have let die. When the greatest generational leader of the Empire consumed the world of Ziost, the Empire rallied medical and relief forces immediately and began an effective hunt that would destroy the most powerful being in the galaxy at the time. Even in the face of genocidal pursuit by the Jedi, the Empire finds a way to build a safe place on a dangerous world known as Dromund Kaas and build a functioning, productive society that becomes a galactic power, all the while safeguarding the lives of the very people that would see it destroyed. 

## The Hutts and Criminal Cartels

A lesser but unnecessary evil, a variety of criminal organizations operate throughout the galaxy. Hutt Space, centered on Hutta and Nar Shaddaa, is probably the largest enclave but outfits are operating almost everywhere. From spice running to slavery to contract killing, these cartels offer any illicit, immoral commodity one could look for. Generally speaking, they prey on the weak and should be regarded with scorn. Luckily, they are easily overrun by Imperial forces on all but their most populated centers.

## The Rogue Sith -- Grathan, Ikoral, Malgus, Dread Masters, and Vitiate

Every so often, some Sith will get the idea that his personal power means he can supplant the Empire. This will result in varying degrees of destruction, depending on the Sith's ideals. Some, like Malgus, believe in the Empire but want to transcend its faults -- these result in conflicts that generally follow the rules of war, and while costly on the military are far less impactful on the average citizenry. Such power plays often occur without being noticed at all by anyone not in a power.

The real evil, though, are those that become overly enamored with the dark side. The dark side is a tool best used on a tight leash -- it offers power but it's a living thing with its own deep mind. Those that peer too long can become mad or sociopathic. The Dread Masters suffered this fate, turning to a nihilistic destructive state where they infected others like a plague and began terraforming worlds into hellscapes. Vitiate did the same and became so self-involved that he failed to recognize that his duty was to his Empire and not to himself -- his selfishness nearly destroyed both Empires he built, were it not for the intervention of loyal Imperials like Lana Beneiko.

These rogue Sith are just as fanatical as the Jedi, but they are far more destructive. They learn to tap so deeply into the dark side that they become the embodiment of entropy, changing everything on a whim. Unforunately for the common person, their intelligence does not match their power, and these changes are devastating or lethal. The Jedi's evil is lesser because it is mere apathy that takes centuries to become dangerous -- these destructive Sith kill wantonly and quickly. They must be eliminated as soon as possible.

## The Great Evil Beyond

There are things even more terrible than Vitiate consuming Ziost or the Dread Masters' terraforming a hellscape on Oricon. There are [ancient things](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lotek%27k) that exist beyond this dimension capable of terrible destruction, and [living mini-planets that consume worlds](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Koros-Strohna). Plagues like the rakghoul disease lurk beneath many worlds. These are only held at bay through the most terrible superweapons, the most powerful Force users, and the most prepared black-ops squads. Beware.
