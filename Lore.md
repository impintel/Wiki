Some information just for our operations:
* We are affiliated with the Sith Empire faction in the game. You can run whatever alignment or class you want, but everyone being in the same faction lets us play together. For roleplay reasons, we're focusing around Sith/Imperial Intelligence, as our two starting players use Operatives.
* * Of course feel free to take your character in whatever direction you want within the faction.
* For Player vs. Player (PvP) events, we will meet at Imperial Intelligence at the Kaas Citadel. This can also be our site for social events, roleplay events, and any other kind of ceremony. All players can unlock a quick-travel to Capital World, and then your standard quick-travel can take you directly to Intelligence.
* For Player vs. Environment (PvE), we'll group up at the command deck on the White Nova, the Harrower-class carrier just west of Vaiken Spacedock. Lots of vendors, flashpoint access, and character bank access makes this location ideal for planning ops.

# How Your Class Connects

Suprisingly, every class in SW:TOR on the Imperial faction ties in with Intelligence efforts. In the Empire, the elite, represented by player characters, are charged with governing and guiding day-to-day efforts of the citizenry, and Intelligence is tasked both with both gaining the information to make good decisions and with enforcing the infrastructure so that the community can thrive.

## Imperial Agent

Agents have the most obvious connection -- they are the most immediate assets to Imperial Intelligence, generally derived from non-Force-using military backgrounds. Dromund Kaas is a survivor culture, created after the Sith Emperor was chased into Unknown Regions after the [the Great Hyperspace War](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Empire/Legends#Great_Hyperspace_War), and the Agent is an ardent believer in doing whatever is necessary to preserve the Empire. Agents take the worst jobs with the lowest survival rates to make sure that the Empire's resources are used to greatest effect.

Agents will be charged with developing assets for the Empire and covertly demolishing enemy networks, to ensure the safety of Dromund Kaas. They work internal security, diplomatic relationships, enemy counterintelligence, and deep cover assignments. They take on enemies foreign and domestic -- sometimes it's hard for Agents to know who their friends are, but their knowledge and information gathering will expose the deepest conspiracies around the Empire.

See [this Fandom summary](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cipher_Nine) of the Agent storyline if you need a review and don't care about.

## Bounty Hunters

Bounty Hunters are hired mucle for the Empire, with the freedom to pursue their own contracts and their own social hierarchy. This independence allows to them to operate where the Empire's control is weakest, and their patrons give them the authority to enforce Imperial law in the heartland.

Hunters will serve classified contracts from Imperial military command throughout their campaign, curated through the Bounty Hunter's Guild. When Imperial assets would be too obvious to use or there were no special-forces available, Bounty Hunters are hired as anonymous black-ops contractors to clear Imperial objectives, coordinated through locations like Imperial dreadnoughts or the [Imperial Special Ops Center](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Special_Ops_Center) on Nar Shaddaa.

See [this Fandom summary](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter_(individual)) of the Hunter storyline if you need a review and don't care about.

## Sith Inquisitors

Sith Inquisitors are drawn from the Force adepts most deeply connected with the [dark side of the Force](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_side_of_the_Force), from any background in the Empire. The Sith trials are arduous and dangerous, but they craft Inquisitors into elite interrogators and truth-seekers to protect the Empire. The strongest Sith form the Dark Council, the ruling body of the Empire, to whom Intelligence directly reports.

While most of the Inquisitor storyline is on curating the legacies and artifacts of now-dead Sith Lords to grow the power of the Empire, they are also the front-line on gleaning information from the dark side of the Force. In a galaxy rife with Force-sensitive organizations, Inquisitors are the most capable assets for gleaning crucial warnings from the Force itself and for stripping answers out of captured enemies.

See [this Fandom summary](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Nox) of the Inquisitor storyline if you need a review and don't care about.

## Sith Warriors

While Sith Warriors are rarely subtle in combat, they do serve a vital role for intelligence operations. [Darth Baras](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Baras), mentor to many promising Sith Warriors, operated key infiltration operations for the Imperial military. Many Warriors would follow in his footsteps, and they would serve as military intelligence and coordination assets during crucial campaigns.

In the intelligence context, Warriors are the enforcers. They are sent to silence compromised Intelligence assets to protect the operation of the network as a whole, and they are a bridge to the Imperial military command structure. Warriors are also skilled in manipulation tactics, using their fearsome reputation and dark-side prowess to turn enemy assets into allies, and they have plenty of black-ops contacts to get their operations finished as efficiently as possible, pushing the relentless march to victory for the Empire.

# Core Reputation Systems
These are the reputation systems we'll focus on -- we'll try to get DAC's organized to clear everything but First Mobile Fleet (which has to be solo).

* THORN: http://dulfy.net/2014/01/21/swtor-thorn-rakghoul-resurgence-event-guide/
* First Mobile Fleet (Imperial Navy): http://dulfy.net/2013/02/12/swtor-galactic-reputation-guide/#4
* Imperial Forward Command (Imperial Navy): http://dulfy.net/2014/02/03/swtor-kuat-drive-yards-tactical-flashpoint-guide/
* Makeb Imperial Forces (Ministry of Logistics): http://dulfy.net/2013/02/12/swtor-galactic-reputation-guide/#7
* Iokath Imperial Forces (Ministry of War): http://dulfy.net/2017/04/19/swtor-iokath-story-and-dailies-guide/
* Ossus Assault Battalion (Ministry of War): http://dulfy.net/2018/12/12/swtor-ossus-dailies-and-patch-5-10-gearing-guide/
* Dantooine Initiative (Ministry of Logistics): https://vulkk.com/2019/06/06/swtor-dantooine-event-and-achievements-guide/

There are other reputation systems:
* Reputation systems like Imperial Guard of Belsalvis and Dread Exectioners on Oricon are better suited for Sith characters for the Force components.
* Those like the Bounty Brokers Association, Galactic Solutions Industries, Nar Shaddaa Nightlife, Rishi, and Ordinance Acquisitions Corps are better for Bounty Hunters as independent contractors.
* Xenological reputation systems like the Gree and Voss are more general sci-fi. Do them as long as you find them fun.
* We generally shun reputation with Republic overlap, like Yavin 4 and Republic Forces on Iokath. The Republic has shown a consistent commitment to genocide against Sith Purebloods, dark-siders, and Dromund Kaas -- we won't help them.
