Some information just for our operations:
* We are affiliated with the Sith Empire faction in the game. You can run whatever alignment or class you want, but everyone being in the same faction lets us play together. For roleplay reasons, we're focusing around Sith/Imperial Intelligence, as our two starting players use Operatives. 
* * Of course feel free to take your character in whatever direction you want within the faction. 
* For Player vs. Player (PvP) events, we will meet at Imperial Intelligence at the Kaas Citadel. This can also be our site for social events, roleplay events, and any other kind of ceremony. All players can unlock a quick-travel to Capital World, and then your standard quick-travel can take you directly to Intelligence.
* For Player vs. Environment (PvE), we'll group up at the command deck on the White Nova, the Harrower-class carrier just west of Vaiken Spacedock. Lots of vendors, flashpoint access, and character bank access makes this location ideal for planning ops.
