# General Policies
* Stay out of general chat as much as possible, unless recruiting for flashpoints and operations. General chat in-game is cancer.
* If you find yourself harassed, DO NOT ANTAGONIZE. Based off Imperial Intelligence, we are a covert group and we need to maintain a low profile. Do not engage -- /ignore and report as needed.
* Guild banks are organized and audited -- be responsible with what you take and don't sell guild resources on the GTN. Donate to backfill what you take -- flagship encryption pays for all of your weekly allotment. 
* Set good example and recruit good people -- everyone can /ginvite. We are not capricious like Sith, glory-driven like Mandalorians, or pompous as Jedi -- we should seek the growth and success of any member of the Imperial faction and we should contribute to the community as a whole.
* Pay attention in group/ops chat during raids -- if you feel like verbal communication is best, use the Raids voice channel.

Conquest is our primary membership-value tracker -- whether you want social PvE (flashpoints and ops), private PvE (crafting, heroics, reputation), or PvP (warzones and starfighter) for your experience, any rank above Fixer requires completing Conquest and donating encryption at least twice per month. Promotions are evaluated on Tuesdays when Conquest resets. Every week you miss a required Conquest clear, you will be demoted

# Ranks

* Agent: Recruit with a DAC-ideal class (see [the guides](./Guides.md) for DAC definition)
