# General Policies
* Stay out of general chat as much as possible, unless recruiting for flashpoints and operations. General chat in-game is cancer.
* If you find yourself harassed, DO NOT ANTAGONIZE. Based off Imperial Intelligence, we are a covert group and we need to maintain a low profile. Do not engage -- /ignore and report as needed.
* Guild banks are organized and audited -- be responsible with what you take and don't sell guild resources on the GTN. Donate to backfill what you take -- flagship encryption pays for all of your weekly allotment.
* Set good example and recruit good people -- everyone can /ginvite. We are not capricious like Sith, glory-driven like Mandalorians, or pompous as Jedi -- we should seek the growth and success of any member of the Imperial faction and we should contribute to the community as a whole.
* Pay attention in group/ops chat during raids -- if you feel like verbal communication is best, use the voice channel.

# Other Guilds
Feel free to join other guilds -- we want you to have the best experience possible. Discord will be our main method of communication, and we welcome you to embed with other guilds and bring what you learn back. Just keep one alt in our guild for guild events, please.

# Conquest and Guild Projects
Conquest is our primary membership-value tracker -- whether you want social PvE (flashpoints and ops), private PvE (crafting, heroics, reputation), or PvP (warzones and starfighter) for your experience, any rank above Fixer requires completing Conquest and donating encryption at least twice per month. Promotions are evaluated on Tuesdays when Conquest resets. Every week you miss a required Conquest clear, you will be demoted back toward Agent/Asset.

# Organizing Events
DAC's should try to meet up every week or so to get used to working together. Feel free to use a voice channel for your operations.
* If a DAC member is absent for Heroics or Flashpoints, the highest companion able to fill the role can be used. Make sure to know the companion's weapon and abilities.
* Flashpoints and Heroic Missions should be able to be cleared by any single DAC.
* Operations will be a coordinated effort between two or four DAC teams -- given our size, we'll usually pair DAC's for 8M SM content, but if our members want to try something harder, they're welcome.
* Conquest Invasions will require mass coordination of many DAC teams -- large-yield will require four or more DAC's to work together within a given week, while small yields can be finished by as few as one dedicated DAC's. We will set conquest based on the previous week's conquest. We need to see 110% of the yield target to set Medium or Large -- otherwise, we will always set Small to earn valuable encryptions.
* _VERY IMPORTANT_: DAC's should be noted on their members' notes so that they can be easily identified and tracked.

# Recruiting

We don't recruit by spamming general chat, ever. Please DO NOT do this.

If you're running a flashpoint with someone and they seem chill, or you find someone in game that seems cool, target them and then hit G to open the guild window. Right-click on the portrait and select Whisper. From there copy-paste the block below:
```
If you're enjoying the Agent storyline, we're working to continue it. We have Discord, guildship with all the banks and vendors, starparse, and regular events. Hit me up to join 
```
And then click the hyperlink button on the guild window. Hit enter to send.
