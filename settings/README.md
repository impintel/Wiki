These are [DarkFeather](DarkFeather)'s personal keybinds and layout settings for SWTOR -- hopefully they can help you in games you're playing. There is one ideosyncracy with this layout: the mouse is on the left. This keeps the typing keys in the middle of the workspace, for comfort chatting, and relies heavily on the numpad and arrowkeys for MMO actions. Since camerawork can be lazy, that's relegated to a normal three-button mouse in the left hand, which can switch to working the modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Tab) while the right can work the rotation on the numpad. A human-readable breakdown of the keybinds is below.

# How to use

Put these files in `%APPDATA%\..\Local\SWTOR\swtor\settings\`. 

I recommend setting the following in `%APPDATA%\..\Local\SWTOR\swtor\settings\*PlayerGUIState` to avoid the cancer of general chat and bring some structure to the in-game chatter.

```
ChatColors = b3ecff;ff7397;ff8022;a59ff3;eeee00;eeee00;B3ECFF;B3ECFF;B3ECFF;1d8cfe;82ec89;FF00FF;EFBC55;317A3C;eeee00;FF0000;eeee00;ff7f7f;EEEE00;EEEE00;EEEE00;eeee00;eeee00;eeee00;eeee00;eeee00;eeee00;eeee00;eeee00;FF5400;eeee00;eeee00;eeee00;A00000;C92E56;BB4FD2;1FAB29;FF6600;
ChatChannels = 1.General.69248125964;2.All.266856218575;4.Ops.129402846732;
ChatPanel_1Index = 7
Chat_Custom_Channels = Gsf;;1;usr.gsf;Impintel;;3;usr.impintel
