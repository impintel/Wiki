# Here's some important starting information.
* Make sure you join the guild for an XP boost and group up with other players as much as possible. This will speed your leveling and let you join in on operations and flashpoints sooner.
* Read up on your class on [Dulfy](http://dulfy.net/) and [Vulkk](http://vulkk.com/) so that you know your rotation, specilization, and role -- the game's much more enjoyable when you understand the abilities and what they do.
* _VERY IMPORTANT:_ Set up a two-factor key on your account and record the secret in a secure place. If you put any kind of time into your characters, this will both get you in-game rewards AND prevent you from losing your progress.
* If you can't find a guide or notes here for what you're trying to do, check out the [ultimate guides thread](https://www.swtor.com/community/showthread.php?t=974581) on SWTOR.com.

Class references on this Wiki are all referential to Imperial classes, but each Imperial class has a Republic class equivalent, should you choose to use one.

## An Example Legacy Progression

*Note:* This layout is not designed for maximizing yield in the game; it's designed with the idea of ensuring clearance on first attempt of content as much as possible. As such, each of these bullets can be considered personal progression points to target, before moving onto the next.

*Second Note*: Each concept is linked to a guide that we feel will help achieve your goals. This includes links to Vulkk, SWTORista, SWTOR-Spy, IGN, and Dulfy.

1. Start with one toon, whichever [class fits you best](./Lore.md), and work on playing all the way through [the class storyline](https://vulkk.com/2017/04/28/swtor-step-by-step-guide-to-leveling-and-gearing-up-your-character-for-endgame/). Use credits on your Legacy Character Perks in the Advancement category, and always equip your highest gear until you're level 75 and iRating 306. Don't worry about Strongholds just yet -- at this point, Vaiken Spacedock and/or Odessen will serve amply.
  1. Work through Veteran Flashpoints until you can unlock the Legacy-wide "Ship Unlocks" and "Convenience" global unlocks.
  1. Work on [Datacrons](http://www.swtor-spy.com/datacrons/) as you pass through each planet. Ask a Minder about the Fleet Datacron runs.
  1. Make sure to complete the [HK-51 storyline](https://www.ign.com/wikis/star-wars-the-old-republic/HK-51_Walkthrough) on this toon, so that you can unlock the Legacy unlock of the companion. This is a good time to mobilize friends, as many players can scan for the parts and everyone can loot it.
  1. Make sure to get one companion to level 50.
  1. At iRating 290, you can start working on [Master-mode Flashpoints](https://vulkk.com/tag/swtor-flashpoints-guides/) for additional loot.
1. Get familiar with the Conquest system, and start finishing this regularly.
1. Join up with a DAC (see below) to start getting a firm grasp on endgame mechanics.
1. Level up one toon from each of the Imperial class storylines until you've completed all companion dialogues and Chapter 3 of their storyline. This gets you emotes, buffs, and Heroic Moment abilities.
1. Look at unlocking and decorating [Strongholds](https://swtorista.com/articles/swtor-stronghold-guide/) for Conquest buffs and social opportunities.
1. Invest in at least one [crafting specialty](https://swtorista.com/articles/crafting-in-onslaught) -- if you're not going to be an avid crafter, Biochem might have the highest utility.
1. Ensure your gear is [properly min-maxed for your role](https://vulkk.com/2017/06/29/swtor-beginners-guide-to-all-classes-and-disciplines/).
1. Start playing [Unranked PvP](https://vulkk.com/2020/08/08/swtor-pvp-endgame-beginners-guide/) and grouping for [8- and 16-man Operations](https://sites.google.com/view/merlyn-swtor/operations?authuser=0) to better learn your main class's abilities and role.
1. Learn GTN flipping and other endgame economics.
1. Consider looking at Hard-mode Operations, Ranked PvP and Nightmare (NiM) Operations to further test yourself.
1. Participate in events to reach Legend status on all [the Reputation systems](http://dulfy.net/2013/02/12/swtor-galactic-reputation-guide/) -- [backup link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112032951/http://dulfy.net/2013/02/12/swtor-galactic-reputation-guide/).
1. Complete the Republic storyline for any remaining Datacrons and Legendary player flair.

# Stealth in SWTOR

We are an intelligence-focused group, and as such we make high use of stealth techniques in all of our operations, from story leveling to operations and PvP.

The real key to stealth is to keep "Target Closest Enemy" on keybind and always watch the buffs and range indicators on the closest enemy. As long as you watch these and know your phases, stealth becomes easy.

## Passive Stealth

Passive stealth is used by staying far enough away from enemy NPC's that they don't attack you. This can be anywhere between 10m and 30m, depending on the operation. Running outside this detection range allows a player to bypass mobs and even some bosses, saving a lot of time and potentially repair bills. This is especially important for classes without other stealth abilities, like Snipers, Sorcerers, Bounty Hunters, and Juggernauts.

A variant of this is using jump-in abilities, like the Assassin's Phantom Stride, Warrior's Force Charge, Operative's Holotraverse, or Powertech's Jet charge to jump over one mob and attack a second. So far, our testing seems to show that detection doesn't work while the ability is active and only the target group will be pulled.

Fair warning: there are location triggers in some maps that will automatically attack players based on location.

## Mechanic-driven Stealth

Mount stealth is using the evasion mechanic in-game to avoid mobs. While mounted, damage reduction and movement speed are increased. Even if mobs detect and attack you, keep driving as far away as quickly as possible; over time, the player character will evade all the NPC's and be free and clear.

Phase stealth allows a player to capitalize on phase exits or event triggers to run through groups of adds and then lose them in the mechanics of the game.

## Singleton Active Stealth Abilities

Three advanced classes have singleton stealth abilities: Marauders, Operatives, and Assassins. Marauders can use Force Camouflage for a very short window and with a cooldown -- while this ability is generally intended to dump threat during boss fights, it also serves effectively to bypass choke points. Assassins and Operatives can make use of different variations on the Stealth ability, which lasts infinitely with a much shorter cooldown than Force Camouflage.

Assassins can use Force Cloak and Operatives can use Cloaking Screen to break combat and enter stealth again. This is helpful for "stealth-rezzing" fallen comrades, so long as you don't aggro more adds when you exit stealth. It also helps avoid adds that you accidentally pulled, although in a group this just passes the threat to the next closest member. Assassins can enhance this with the Two Cloaks tactical, at the expense of other DPS or damage mitigation.

Be aware that some enemies have a stealth detection ability. Some cast an area-of-effect with a visible animation to do that; these you can time your movement to bypass. Others, particularly bosses, will have a buff that detects stealth within a certain range. No stealth ability will get you past these.

## Group Stealth Abilities

Assassins and Operatives have an ability that can allow them to stealth a group inside detection range. For Assassins, this is Mind Maze and for Operatives it's Sleep Dart. You can use these abilities to stun adds at choke points and allow non-stealth classes to slip past. Assassins even have a tactical, Multitrap, that allows multiple of these stealth stuns.

Operatives have a final ability that has remarkable utility. Assuming that your group isn't solely made up of Assassins and Operatives, these stealth CC's will only allow a group to control 1-3 adds. Operatives, though, have a mass-cloak ability called Infiltrate that allows them to cloak an entire group for a short time. The best way to use this ability is for the Operative to tell the group to stack up on one player and run. The Operative then chases the group to keep them within the area of effect.

# Direct Action Cell (DAC)
Direct Action Cells are a unique concept for us. Cells are an attempt to get players to play to their strengths and still have fun. Ideally, DAC's will be formed of four players who can meet up at least once a week to run some flashpoints together. A given member can be part of more than one DAC, so long as they can always be around for their cell.

Individual DAC's do not follow a leader-followers paradigm -- each cell member is expected to sound off with tactics that they think will make the run easier, and barring any objections the rest of the cell should follow. Those who don't know should listen to those that do, but if someone wants to try something new, the cell should accommodate within reason. This is to turn the cell into a living, adaptive suite where cell members recognize tasks that not only make their life easier but also help out the others. Eventually, with enough practice, a DAC will be able to complete smooth runs on all missions without even needing to type in chat.

There are four roles in a DAC:
* Tank: These units are always the first hitters to make contact in any engagement. Even in a stealth unit, they need to be able to be loud and they need to chose the right strategy for initial contact. In the absence of voice comms, everyone follows the tank and executes their own role. As such, tanks are de-facto commanders.
* * Exemplar: the Darkness Sith Assassin -- cloak-capable and high damage mitigation.
* * Other classes include Sith Juggernauts and BH Powertechs.
* RDPS: The recon-driven RDPS are responsible for picking off adds and watching for mechanic changes in the game. They're shielded by the CQC units so they can focus on putting lead down range.
* Their exemplar is the Imperial Agent RDPS -- they can generally stay far enough away to not pull enemies, and while they (and all ranged DPS) lack stealth, they can be hidden by the DAC's stealth mechanics.
* * Other options include the Sith Sorceror and Mercenaries.
* Medic: No plan ever survives contact with the enemy, so the medics are around to keep everyone alive. Primarily a support class, the medics skills will make or break hard scenarios. Their knowledge also works as science and crafting officer.
* * Exemplar: the Medicine Imperial Agent Operative -- the only stealth-capable healing specialty.
* * Other options include Mercenaries and Sith Sorcerers.
* MDPS: Melee DPS are the close-quarters elimination specialists. Their job is to cause chaos within the enemy ranks, they float between covering all other members of the team. Specialized correctly, they can also fill in a second player in any other role -- shields and stuns for tanking, grenades, darts, and rifles for ranged, and medical probes for healing. This means the melee DPS needs to understand every other role and pay attention to how each team member is doing. Effectively, they become the communications officer.
* * Exemplar: the Lethality Imperial Agent Operative -- stealth-capable with a large toolbox of stealth and damage-dealing abilities.
* * Other options include Sith Warriors, Sith Assassins, and BH Powertechs.

Below are some example DAC formations by class. Each DAC should form according to their player's preferences first and foremost. One could learn to run a four-person team of all Lethality Operatives, for example, with the right coordination -- skill and class understanding will trump any prebuilt group. Use these as starting blocks for how you want to organize your DAC.

## Some DAC formations
These formations optimize heals, damage mitigation, and damage dealing. They are ordered first by game, then by balance, and lastly by utility.

| Nickname | Game | Tank | DPS  | DPS  | Heal |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Keeper's Ghosts | SWTOR | Darkness Assassin | Carnage Marauder | Lethality Operative | Medicine Operative |
| Emperor's Hands | SWTOR | Darkness Assassin | Concealment Operative | Virulence Sniper | Medicine Operative |
| Vader's Fist | SWTOR | Immortal Juggernaut | Advanced Prototype Powertech | Deception Assassin | Corruption Sorcerer |
| Mandalore's Wrath | SWTOR | Shieldtech Powertech | Arsenal Mercenary | Engineering Sniper | Bodyguard Mercenary |
| Krennic's Revenge (Shoretrooper Skin) | Battlefront II | Shielded Heavy | Assault | Specialist | Officer |
| Revived 181st | Squadrons | TIE defender | TIE bomber | TIE interceptor | TIE reaper |

## Three-player DAC formations
These are just some topical formations for three-man teams. They should use a ranged companion as a healer and focus on DPS. They're primarily intended for Veteran flashpoints, dailies, and heroics where their high DPS allows for speedruns.

| Nickname | Game | DPS  | DPS  | DPS  |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Inferno | SWTOR | Lethality Operative | Concealment Operative | Marksman Sniper |
| Triumvirate | SWTOR | Rage Marauder | Madness Sorceror | Hatred Assassin |
| Crimson Dawn | SWTOR | Advanced Prototype Powertech | Arsenal Mercenary | Pyrotech Mercenary |

# Common Squad Commands
See [the master thread](http://www.swtor.com/community/showthread.php?t=822400): for a breakdown of terms.
* _ORDER_: Form up with cloaked MDPS on point, Tank on sweep, RDPS in the middle, and heals on rearguard.
* _STEALTH_: Speedrun past all mobs -- the Operatives will need to take turns with Infiltrate to hide the non-cloaking classes past groups larger than 3. Otherwise, the CC order follows the marching order.
* _COVERED PULL_: The Tank and MDPS tag-team all Close-Quarters combat (CQC) after the Tank's charge -- Tank should use Guard on MDPS and MDPS applies any damage reduction or heals (like Kolto Probe) on the Tank. This mitigates a lot of damage. The heals and ranged act as a sniper-spotter pair (SSP), keeping adds off the CQC and heals on them. Ideally, tank and MDPS/SSP will be on opposite sides of the boss to avoid cleaves.
* _LOS STUN_: The stealth classes CC as many targets as they can, then the RDPS uses an AoE and teleport to pull and port back to safety. Tank takes over threat with en-masse and DPS rotate mass stuns. Damage-dealers spam AoE while heals uses AoH on party.
* _FALLBACK_: CQC cloaks or threat-dumps, and RDPS takes threat. All group on SSP until rejuvenated, then Tanks uses mass taunt to lead CQC and foes away from SSP. Most RDPS have a strong DCD rotations, but this fallback has to be executed quickly before that rotation burns out. Otherwise, you'll end up burning a combat-resurrection on the RDPS.
* _EQUALIZE_: SSP picks one boss, and CQC picks another. All should set up a focus target on the other boss and put all their DPS on their own. Bosses should only die within 5% HP of each other.
* _SPREAD_: A rare tactic for clearing areas of little mobs, members chose a direction in order and scatter to kill as many adds as possible, even heals.
* _SWEEP_: Circle the boss, clearing out all mobs without pulling a boss.
* _TUCK_: Watch for large cast from the boss and tuck behind a corner to break line of sight. This break on an immobile or slow boss will diffuse all the damage on the environment and not on the party.

# StarParse
[StarParse](http://www.ixparse.com/) is a tool for checking your stats in SWTOR. You can use it solo or as part of a group. We have the `ImperialIntel` raid group in StarParse -- password is posted in the pinned message in #dromundkaas on Discord.

Simple way to set it up is to do the following:
* Download and install from http://www.ixparse.com/.
* In the game go to Settings > Game > Combat Logging and toggle `Enable combat logging to file`.
* In StarParse, go to File > Settings > Raiding, and add the ImperialIntel raid group with the posted password.
* In StarParse, make sure you have ImperialIntel checked under Raiding.

Now you're set up! To parse, all you have to do is be in the game and have StarParse open. From there, in StarParse, click the Parse and Raiding buttons in the top and the overlay will pop up. Start fighting a dummy or start working on a flashpoint, and you'll see your stats filter in.
