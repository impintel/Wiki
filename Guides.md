# Here's some important starting information.
* Make sure you join the guild for an XP boost and group up with other players as much as possible. This will speed your leveling and let you join in on operations and flashpoints sooner.
* Read up on your class on [Dulfy](http://dulfy.net/) and [Vulkk](http://vulkk.com/) so that you know your rotation, specilization, and role -- the game's much more enjoyable when you understand the abilities and what they do.
* _VERY IMPORTANT:_ Set up a two-factor key on your account and record the secret in a secure place. If you put any kind of time into your characters, this will both get you in-game rewards AND prevent you from losing your progress.
* If you can't find a guide or notes here for what you're trying to do, check out the [ultimate guides thread](https://www.swtor.com/community/showthread.php?t=974581) on SWTOR.com.

# Direct Action Cell (DAC)
Direct Action Cells are a unique concept for us. Cells are an attempt to get players to play to their strengths and still have fun. Ideally, DAC's will be formed of four players who can meet up at least once a week to run some flashpoints together. A given member can be part of more than one DAC, so long as they can always be around for their cell.

There are four roles in a DAC:
* Tank: These units are always the first hitters to make contact in any engagement. Even in a stealth unit, they need to be able to be loud and they need to chose the right strategy for initial contact. In the absence of voice comms, everyone follows the tank and executes their own role. As such, tanks are de-facto commanders.
* * Exemplar: the Darkness Sith Assassin -- cloak-capable and high damage mitigation.
* * Other classes include Sith Juggernauts and BH Powertechs.
* RDPS: The recon-driven RDPS are responsible for picking off adds and watching for mechanic changes in the game. They're shielded by the CQC units so they can focus on putting lead down range.
* Their exemplar is the Imperial Agent RDPS -- they can generally stay far enough away to not pull enemies, and while they (and all ranged DPS) lack stealth, they can be hidden by the DAC's stealth mechanics.
* * Other options include the Sith Sorceror and Mercenaries.
* Medic: No plan ever survives contact with the enemy, so the medics are around to keep everyone alive. Primarily a support class, the medics skills will make or break hard scenarios. Their knowledge also works as science and crafting officer.
* * Exemplar: the Medicine Imperial Agent Operative -- the only stealth-capable healing specialty.
* * Other options include Mercenaries and Sith Sorcerors.
* MDPS: Melee DPS are the close-quarters elimination specialists. Their job is to cause chaos within the enemy ranks, they float between covering all other members of the team. Specialized correctly, they can also fill in a second player in any other role -- shields and stuns for tanking, grenades, darts, and rifles for ranged, and medical probes for healing. This means the melee DPS needs to understand every other role and pay attention to how each team member is doing. Effectively, they become the communications officer.
* * Exemplar: the Lethality Imperial Agent Operative -- stealth-capable with a large toolbox of stealth and damage-dealing abilities.
* * Other options include Sith Warriors, Sith Assassins, and BH Powertechs.

# Common Squad Commands
See http://www.swtor.com/community/showthread.php?t=822400): for a breakdown of terms.
* _ORDER_: Form up with MDPS on point, Tank on sweep, RDPS in the middle, and heals on rearguard.
* _STEALTH_: Speedrun past all mobs -- the Operatives will need to take turns with Infiltrate to hide the non-cloaking classes past groups larger than 3. Otherwise, the CC order follows the marching order.
* _COVERED PULL_: The Tank and MDPS tag-team all Close-Quarters combat (CQC) after the Tank's charge -- Tank should use Guard on MDPS and MDPS applies any damage reduction or heals (like Kolto Probe) on the Tank. This mitigates a lot of damage. The heals and Sniper act as a sniper-spotter pair (SSP), keeping adds off the CQC and heals on them.
* _LOS STUN_: The stealth classes CC as many targets as they can, then the RDPS uses an AoE and teleport to pull and port back to safety. Tank takes over threat with en-masse and DPS rotate mass stuns. Damage-dealers spam AoE while heals uses AoH on party.
* _FALLBACK_: CQC cloaks or threat-dumps, and RDPS takes threat. All group on SSP until rejuvenated, then Tanks uses Mass Mind Control to lead CQC and foes away from SSP. Most RDPS have a strong DCD rotations, but this fallback has to be executed quickly before that rotation burns out. Otherwise, you'll end up burning a combat-resurrection on the RDPS.
* _EQUALIZE_: SSP picks one boss, and CQC picks another. All should set up a focus target on the other boss and put all their DPS on their own. Bosses should only die within 5% HP of each other.
* _SPREAD_: A rare tactic for clearing areas of little mobs, members chose a direction in order and scatter to kill as many adds as possible, even heals.

# StarParse
[StarParse](http://www.ixparse.com/) is a tool for checking your stats in SWTOR. You can use it solo or as part of a group. We have the `ImperialIntel` raid group in StarParse -- password is posted in the pinned message in #dromundkaas on Discord.

Simple way to set it up is to do the following:
* Download and install from http://www.ixparse.com/.
* In the game go to Settings > Game > Combat Logging and toggle `Enable combat logging to file`.
* In StarParse, go to File > Settings > Raiding, and add the ImperialIntel raid group with the posted password.
* In StarParse, make sure you have ImperialIntel checked under Raiding.

Now you're set up! To parse, all you have to do is be in the game and have StarParse open. From there, in StarParse, click the Parse and Raiding buttons in the top and the overlay will pop up. Start fighting a dummy or start working on a flashpoint, and you'll see your stats filter in.
