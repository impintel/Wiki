# Here's some important starting information.
* Make sure you join the guild for an XP boost and group up with other players as much as possible. This will speed your leveling and let you join in on operations and flashpoints sooner.
* Read up on your class on [Dulfy](http://dulfy.net/) and [Vulkk](http://vulkk.com/) so that you know your rotation, specilization, and role -- the game's much more enjoyable when you understand the abilities and what they do.
* _VERY IMPORTANT:_ Set up a two-factor key on your account and record the secret in a secure place. If you put any kind of time into your characters, this will both get you in-game rewards AND prevent you from losing your progress.
* If you can't find a guide or notes here for what you're trying to do, check out the [ultimate guides thread](https://www.swtor.com/community/showthread.php?t=974581) on SWTOR.com.

## An Example Legacy Progression

*Note:* This layout is not designed for maximumizing yield in the game; it's designed with the idea of ensuring clearance on first attempt of content as much as possible. As such, each of these bullets can be considered personal progression points to target, before moving onto the next.

1. Start with one toon, whichever [class fits you best](./Lore.md), and work on playing all the way through the class storyline. Use credits on your Legacy Character Perks in the Advancement category, and always equip your highest gear until you're level 75 and iRating 306. Don't worry about Strongholds just yet -- at this point, Vaiken Spacedock and/or Odessen will serve amply.
  1. Work through Veteran Flashpoints until you can unlock the Legacy-wide "Ship Unlocks" and "Convenience" global unlocks.
  1. Work on Datacrons as you pass through each planet. Ask a Minder about the Fleet datacron runs.
  1. Make sure to complete the HK-51 storyline on this toon, so that you can unlock the Legacy unlock of the companion.
  1. Make sure to get one companion to level 50.
  1. At iRating 290, you can start working on Master-mode Flashpoints for additional loot.
1. Get familiar with the Conquest system, and start finishing this regularly.
1. Join up with a DAC (see below) to start getting a firm grasp on endgame mechanics.
1. Level up one toon from each of the Imperial class storylines until you've completed all companion dialogs and Chapter 3 of their storyline. This gets you emotes, buffs, and Heroic Moment abilities.
1. Look at unlocking and decorating Strongholds for Conquest buffs and social opportunities.
1. Invest in at least one crafting specialty -- if you're not going to be an avid crafter, Biochem might have the highest utility.
1. Start playing Unranked PvP and grouping for 8- and 16-man Operations to better learn your main class's abilities and role.
1. Learn GTN flipping and other endgame economics.
1. Ensure your gear is properly min-maxed for your role -- guides are readily available.
1. Consider looking at Hard-mode Operations, Ranked PvP and Nightmare (NiM) Operations to further test yourself.
1. Participate in events to reach Legend status on all the Reputation systems.
1. Complete the Republic storyline for any remaining datacrons and Legendary player flair.

# Direct Action Cell (DAC)
Direct Action Cells are a unique concept for us. Cells are an attempt to get players to play to their strengths and still have fun. Ideally, DAC's will be formed of four players who can meet up at least once a week to run some flashpoints together. A given member can be part of more than one DAC, so long as they can always be around for their cell.

There are four roles in a DAC:
* Tank: These units are always the first hitters to make contact in any engagement. Even in a stealth unit, they need to be able to be loud and they need to chose the right strategy for initial contact. In the absence of voice comms, everyone follows the tank and executes their own role. As such, tanks are de-facto commanders.
* * Exemplar: the Darkness Sith Assassin -- cloak-capable and high damage mitigation.
* * Other classes include Sith Juggernauts and BH Powertechs.
* RDPS: The recon-driven RDPS are responsible for picking off adds and watching for mechanic changes in the game. They're shielded by the CQC units so they can focus on putting lead down range.
* Their exemplar is the Imperial Agent RDPS -- they can generally stay far enough away to not pull enemies, and while they (and all ranged DPS) lack stealth, they can be hidden by the DAC's stealth mechanics.
* * Other options include the Sith Sorceror and Mercenaries.
* Medic: No plan ever survives contact with the enemy, so the medics are around to keep everyone alive. Primarily a support class, the medics skills will make or break hard scenarios. Their knowledge also works as science and crafting officer.
* * Exemplar: the Medicine Imperial Agent Operative -- the only stealth-capable healing specialty.
* * Other options include Mercenaries and Sith Sorcerors.
* MDPS: Melee DPS are the close-quarters elimination specialists. Their job is to cause chaos within the enemy ranks, they float between covering all other members of the team. Specialized correctly, they can also fill in a second player in any other role -- shields and stuns for tanking, grenades, darts, and rifles for ranged, and medical probes for healing. This means the melee DPS needs to understand every other role and pay attention to how each team member is doing. Effectively, they become the communications officer.
* * Exemplar: the Lethality Imperial Agent Operative -- stealth-capable with a large toolbox of stealth and damage-dealing abilities.
* * Other options include Sith Warriors, Sith Assassins, and BH Powertechs.

Below are some example DAC formations by class. Each DAC should form according to their player's preferences first and foremost. One could learn to run a four-person team of all Lethality Operatives, for example, with the right coordination -- skill and class understanding will trump any prebuilt group. Use these as starting blocks for how you want to organize your DAC.

## Some DAC formations
These formations optimize heals, damage mitigation, and damage dealing. They are ordered first by game, then by balance, and lastly by utility.

| Nickname | Game | Tank | DPS1 | DPS2 | Heal |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Keeper's Ghosts | SWTOR | Darkness Assassin | Carnage Marauder | Lethality Operative | Medicine Operative |
| Emperor's Hands | SWTOR | Darkness Assassin | Lethality Operative | Virulence Sniper | Medicine Operative |
| Mandalore's Wrath | SWTOR | Shieldtech Powertech | Carnage Marauder | Deception Assassin | Bodyguard Mercenary |
| Vader's Fist | SWTOR | Immortal Juggernaut | Pyrotech Powertech | Engineering Sniper | Corruption Sorcerer |
| Krennic's Revenge (Shoretrooper Skin) | Battlefront II | Shielded Heavy | Assault | Specialist | Officer |

## Three-man DAC formations
These are just some topical formations for three-man teams. They should use a ranged companion as a healer and focus on DPS. They're primarily intended for Veteran flashpoints, dailies, and heroics where their high DPS allows for speedruns.

| Nickname | Game | DPS1 | DPS2 | DPS2 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Inferno | SWTOR | Lethality Operative | Concealment Operative | Marksman Sniper |
| Triumvirate | SWTOR | Rage Marauder | Madness Sorceror | Hatred Assassin |
| Crimson Dawn | SWTOR | Advanced Prototype Powertech | Arsenal Mercenary | Pyrotech Mercenary |

# Common Squad Commands
See [the master thread](http://www.swtor.com/community/showthread.php?t=822400): for a breakdown of terms.
* _ORDER_: Form up with MDPS on point, Tank on sweep, RDPS in the middle, and heals on rearguard.
* _STEALTH_: Speedrun past all mobs -- the Operatives will need to take turns with Infiltrate to hide the non-cloaking classes past groups larger than 3. Otherwise, the CC order follows the marching order.
* _COVERED PULL_: The Tank and MDPS tag-team all Close-Quarters combat (CQC) after the Tank's charge -- Tank should use Guard on MDPS and MDPS applies any damage reduction or heals (like Kolto Probe) on the Tank. This mitigates a lot of damage. The heals and Sniper act as a sniper-spotter pair (SSP), keeping adds off the CQC and heals on them.
* _LOS STUN_: The stealth classes CC as many targets as they can, then the RDPS uses an AoE and teleport to pull and port back to safety. Tank takes over threat with en-masse and DPS rotate mass stuns. Damage-dealers spam AoE while heals uses AoH on party.
* _FALLBACK_: CQC cloaks or threat-dumps, and RDPS takes threat. All group on SSP until rejuvenated, then Tanks uses Mass Mind Control to lead CQC and foes away from SSP. Most RDPS have a strong DCD rotations, but this fallback has to be executed quickly before that rotation burns out. Otherwise, you'll end up burning a combat-resurrection on the RDPS.
* _EQUALIZE_: SSP picks one boss, and CQC picks another. All should set up a focus target on the other boss and put all their DPS on their own. Bosses should only die within 5% HP of each other.
* _SPREAD_: A rare tactic for clearing areas of little mobs, members chose a direction in order and scatter to kill as many adds as possible, even heals.

# StarParse
[StarParse](http://www.ixparse.com/) is a tool for checking your stats in SWTOR. You can use it solo or as part of a group. We have the `ImperialIntel` raid group in StarParse -- password is posted in the pinned message in #dromundkaas on Discord.

Simple way to set it up is to do the following:
* Download and install from http://www.ixparse.com/.
* In the game go to Settings > Game > Combat Logging and toggle `Enable combat logging to file`.
* In StarParse, go to File > Settings > Raiding, and add the ImperialIntel raid group with the posted password.
* In StarParse, make sure you have ImperialIntel checked under Raiding.

Now you're set up! To parse, all you have to do is be in the game and have StarParse open. From there, in StarParse, click the Parse and Raiding buttons in the top and the overlay will pop up. Start fighting a dummy or start working on a flashpoint, and you'll see your stats filter in.

# Crafting
See [SWTORISTA's Crafting Guide](https://swtorista.com/articles/crafting-in-onslaught/) and our [Lore page](./Lore.md) for a way to lay ut crafters on your Legacy.
