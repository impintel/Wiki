# Here's some important starting information.
* Make sure you join the guild for a 10% XP boost and group up with other players as much as possible. This will speed your leveling and let you join in on operations and flashpoints sooner.
* Read up on your class on [Dulfy](http://dulfy.net/) and [Vulkk](http://vulkk.com/) so that you know your rotation, specilization, and role -- the game's much more enjoyable when you understand the abilities and what they do.
* _VERY IMPORTANT:_ Set up a two-factor key on your account and record the secret in a secure place. If you put any kind of time into your characters, this will both get you in-game rewards AND prevent you from losing your progress.

# Core Reputation Systems
These are the reputation systems we'll focus on -- we'll try to get DAC's organized to clear everything but First Mobile Fleet (which has to be solo). 

* THORN: http://dulfy.net/2014/01/21/swtor-thorn-rakghoul-resurgence-event-guide/
* First Mobile Fleet (Imperial Navy): http://dulfy.net/2013/02/12/swtor-galactic-reputation-guide/#4 
* Imperial Forward Command (Imperial Navy): http://dulfy.net/2014/02/03/swtor-kuat-drive-yards-tactical-flashpoint-guide/
* Makeb Imperial Forces (Ministry of Logistics): http://dulfy.net/2013/02/12/swtor-galactic-reputation-guide/#7
* Iokath Imperial Forces (Ministry of War): http://dulfy.net/2017/04/19/swtor-iokath-story-and-dailies-guide/
* Ossus Assault Battalion (Ministry of War): http://dulfy.net/2018/12/12/swtor-ossus-dailies-and-patch-5-10-gearing-guide/
* Dantooine Initiative (Ministry of Logistics): https://vulkk.com/2019/06/06/swtor-dantooine-event-and-achievements-guide/

There are other reputation systems:
* Reputation systems like Imperial Guard of Belsalvis and Dread Exectioners on Oricon are better suited for Sith characters for the Force components.
* Those like the Bounty Brokers Association, Galactic Solutions Industries, Nar Shaddaa Nightlife, Rishi, and Ordinance Acquisitions Corps are better for Bounty Hunters as independent contracts.
* Xenological reputation systems like the Gree and Voss are more general sci-fi. Do them as long as you find them fun.
* We generally shun reputation with Republic overlap, like Yavin 4 and Republic Forces on Iokath. The Republic has shown a consistent commitment to genocide against Sith Purebloods, dark-siders, and Dromund Kaas -- we won't help them.

# Direct Action Cell (DAC)
Direct Action Cells are an AniNIX concept. Cells are an attempt to get players to play to their strengths and still have fun. There are four roles in a DAC:
* Tank: These units are always the first hitters to make contact in any engagement. Even in a stealth unit, they need to be able to be loud and they need to chose the right strategy for initial contact. In the absence of voice comms, everyone follows the tank and executes their own role. As such, tanks are de-facto commanders. Exemplar: the Darkness Sith Assassin -- cloak-capable and high damage mitigation.
* RDPS: The recon-driven RDPS are responsible for picking off adds and watching for mechanic changes in the game. They're shielded by the CQC units so they can focus on putting lead down range. Their exemplar is the Imperial Agent Sniper -- they can generally stay far enough away to not pull enemies, and while they (and all ranged DPS) lack stealth, they can be hidden by the DAC's stealth mechanics. 
* Medic: No plan ever survives contact with the enemy, so the medics are around to keep everyone alive. Primarily a support class, the medics skills will make or break hard scenarios. Their knowledge also works as science and crafting officer. Exemplar: the Medicine Imperial Agent Operative -- the only stealth-capable healing specialty.
* MDPS: Melee DPS are the close-quarters elimination specialists. Their job is to cause chaos within the enemy ranks, they float between covering all other members of the team. Specialized correctly, they can also fill in a second player in any other role -- shields and stuns for tanking, grenades, darts, and rifles for ranged, and medical probes for healing. This means the melee DPS needs to understand every other role and pay attention to how each team member is doing. Effectively, they become the communications officer. Exemplar: the Lethality Imperial Agent Operative -- stealth-capable with a large toolbox of stealth and damage-dealing abilities.

# Common Squad Commands
See http://www.swtor.com/community/showthread.php?t=822400): for a breakdown of terms.
* _ORDER_: Form up with Lethality on point, Assassin on sweep, Sniper in the middle, and Medicine on rearguard. 
* _STEALTH_: Speedrun past all mobs -- the Operatives will need to take turns with Infiltrate to hide the Sniper past groups larger than 3. Otherwise, the CC order follows the marching order.
* _COVERED PULL_: The Assassin and Lethality tag-team all Close-Quarters combat (CQC) after the Assassin's charge -- Assassin should use Guard on Lethality and Lethality Kolto Probe on the Assassin. This mitigates a lot of damage. The Medicine and Sniper act as a sniper-spotter pair (SSP), keeping adds off the CQC and heals on them.
* _LOS STUN_: The Operatives and Assassin CC three targets, then the Sniper uses Orbital Strike and Holotraverse to pull and port back to safety. Assassin takes over threat with Mass Mind Control and Operatives rotate Debilitate. Sniper and Lethality spam AoE while Medicine uses AoH on party.
* _FALLBACK_: CQC cloaks, and Sniper takes threat. All group on SSP until rejuvenated, then Assassin uses Mass Mind Control to lead CQC and foes away from SSP. 
* _EQUALIZE_: SSP picks one boss, and CQC picks another. All should set up a focus target on the other boss and put all their DPS on their own. Bosses should only die within 5% HP of each other. 
* _SPREAD_: A rare tactic for clearing areas of little mobs, members chose a direction in order and scatter to kill as many adds as possible, even Medicine.

# Organizing DACs
These tactics are based on our dream DAC loadout. Other classes, like Sith Warriors and Bounty Hunters, offer other benefits and can be worked into their DAC by fitting into their strengths. The DAC rotation and tactics below would need to be adjusted to fit -- each cell will find their own balance.
* If a DAC member is absent for Heroics or Flashpoints, the highest companion able to fill the role can be used. Make sure to know the companion's weapon and abilities. Exemplars: Lana Beneiko or Xalek as tank, Talos Drellik or Doctor Lokin as heals, Kaliyo or Raina as ranged DPS, and Vector or Ashara as melee DPS. Alternately to use droids, T4-1D or HK with Imperial Assault costume as tank, A7 or Probe Droid as MDPS, Z0-0M as RDPS, and 2V-R8 as heals. SCORPIO is a bad choice...
* Flashpoints and Heroic Missions should be able to be cleared by any single DAC.
* Operations will be a coordinated effort between two or four DAC teams.
* Invasions will require mass coordination of many DAC teams -- large-yield will require 20 DAC's to work together within a given week, while small yields can be finished by as few as 3 dedicated DAC's.
* _VERY IMPORTANT_: DAC members should be noted on their member note so that they can be easily identified and tracked.
