# Imperial Intelligence

We play [Star Wars: The Old Republic](http://swtor.com/) on the Satele Shan server for mental reset, team-building and micromanagement training. We primarily play for the Sith Empire for its more convincing storyline, diverse cultural references, and general grimdark atmosphere. In particular, we have found resonance with the [Imperial Intelligence](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Intelligence_(Sith_Empire) organization, and we have organized ourselves to maintain their ideals across time.

# Structure

Imperial Intelligence is formed of a loose, laissez-faire structure. The goal is to optimize our Agents' independence and resources while maintaining minimal necessary structure such that operations are smooth.
* Agents are given as many resources as possible; in return, they're encouraged to pass along information to the organization as a whole and participate in events as IRL time allows.
* Agents are also organized into Direct-Action Cells (DAC's) led by Watchers or Ciphers -- these are close-knit, four-man teams meant to create unit coherence and smooth multiplayer operations. Most team-based games, including SWTOR and Battlefront, use a four-man structure, hence the number.
* Agents and DAC's get organized by Directorates by Minders.
* Keeper is charged with gatekeeping these policies and the Discord server to unite the Directorates under a unified banner, maintaining the continuity of Intelligence.

## Directorates within SWTOR

Our default Directorate is our main guild within SWTOR, `<Impérial Intélligence>`. Keeper serves as the Minder for this operation and regularly schedules events -- this is far and away our most central operation, and we ask players to focus on contributing here as much as possible, to carry the banner forward. 

A part of our policies is remaining covert -- as such, we are specifically avoiding the conquest of planets within SWTOR. To that end, we need to maximize our rewards while arbitrarily keeping our Conquest numbers below any planetary leaderboards. The SWTOR limit of 1000 characters per guild, along with our no-purge policy, also means that vassal guilds provide more capacity over time. Minder One is overseeing `<The Infiltration Directorate>` as our Republic-subversion presence, though activity within Republic space is low. Minder Two has been accepted to operate the `<Shadow Collective>` as a Mandalorian Directorate of Intelligence.

We are very cautiously accepting much smaller guilds into our fold. Requirements for these vassal guilds are as listed below, and membership is solely at the discretion of Keeper.
* Strong existing member cohesion
* Already purchased significant in-game structure, such as a guildship, guild banks, and strongholds
* Capable of clearing medium-yield Conquest without assistance
* Demonstrated ability to contribute to our events and follow our policies
* An agreement to not recruit members from other Directorates without express communication with and approval from the Minders of the same.

## Directorates of other games

Few surviving factions know the recurring cycle of defeat, development, victory, and peacetime as do those within the Sith Empire. Even within the game, Intelligence has been broken and rebuilt a few times over. We learn from this lesson and the Sith code by breaking free of a single game.

To form a Directorate, a Minder needs to talk with Keeper about a plan to institute our policies and DAC structure within the same. When the plan is solid, a topical role and category will be created for the Minder to use, and operation of the Directorate within that game will be delegated to the Minder in question.

[Holdfast](https://store.steampowered.com/app/589290/Holdfast_Nations_At_War/)'s 9th Legion Marines and [Elder Scrolls Online](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/306130/)'s ImperialIntelligenceSWTOR guilds are Directorates under Minder One's oversight.
