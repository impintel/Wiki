These are our regularly scheduled events.

# Teaching Veteran Flashpoints

This progression is for folks new to the game to learn their class, abilities, rotations, and mechanics. Veteran flashpoints are much more forgiving and a good place to educate. These sign-ups are not for experienced players who want to speedrun and are easily frustrated with newcomers.

Minimum requirement is completing the starter planet -- once off Hutta or Korriban for the first time, Black Talon becomes accessible and more flashpoints will rapidly unlock as a player levels.

m.create --advanced -title "Flashpoints to Teach Mechanics and Abilities" -description "We will be running Veteran flashpoints to teach basic mechanics and abilities in SWTOR starting at 2100 US Central. Agents who sign up for several of these events are eligible for prizes from the Strategic Cache. <@!288682929180114954> will lead and fill any role needed. If multiple groups sign up, we will split by experience level so the groups have even balance of new and experienced members. Hopefully this will enhance your gameplay experience and open doors for you to get more loot!" -date "2020-11-21"

# Master-mode Progression

This progression is for experienced players looking to make conquest points, in-game loot, and unlock achievements. Mastermodes are best done with a known, communicating group. Being smaller than raids, there's less room for error, as the operational unit has less redundancy. However, at the same time, the bosses are weaker and don't hit as hard, so they're still accessible before endgame.

Minimum requirements: [290 gear](https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/dos9kd/recommended_gear_for_master_mode_flashpoints/), level 75, and a balanced team. How you balance your team is your call.

Please note that repeated failure to clear the basic mastermodes like Boarding Party will result in the player being requested to go back to the Veteran progression so their rotation/gear can be sorted out.

Minder Zero event command:
```
m.create --advanced -title "Master-mode Flashpoint Progression" -description "We will be running a Master-mode flashpoint progression starting at 2240 US Central. Agents should have a gear rating of 280 or better and be familiar with their class's abilities. <@!288682929180114954> will lead the first DAC as Lethality MDPS -- we either need a proper DAC or will fall back to the three-man tactics. Please talk with a Minder to ensure you know your squad and progression." -date "2020-11-21"
